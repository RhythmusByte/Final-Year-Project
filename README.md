## Topic: 
Restaurant Reservation and Management System

### Description

The project is based on a **Restaurent Reservation and Management System**. The project will be a web app. The project have mainly 4 users.
- [Customer](Project/Customer.md)
- [Waiter](Project/Waiter.md)
- [Chef](Project/Chef.md)
- [Owner](Project/Owner.md)

We are planned to use **React.JS** for the front-end, by utilizing the React.JS the job of making it to an app will be slightly easier and also React is more easier to learn and the features of the react will be a benefit for our project. For the back-end we will be using **Python Django**, for selecting Django over Java and Node.js is the ease of learning, readability and handling. We know Django will be slower than other two but it won't affect our project also by using python if we are adding any AI features in the near future it will be more easier than the other two. For database we opted in for a *"No Query"* approach by utilizing either **MongoDB** or **Firebase**. For storing the images we are going to use the **Cloudinary** software, because it's free and easy to store images and  convert images into URL's. Now for the hosting we are planned to use either one of the **Vercel** or **Netlify** platforms, because they are handy and free to use. Finally it's a team project so we are gonna utilize the **GitHub** platform, which helps us to maintain our project and collaborate with each other simultaneously. 

> Technologies that are planned to use

- React 
- Python Django
- MongoDB or Firebase
- Cloudinary
- Vercel
- GitHub

> Nb: Even though we are utilizing GitHub, currently we are not not planned to make it an open-source project.
